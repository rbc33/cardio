Understood. Here are several datasets with fictional patient profiles. I've added more variability and less obvious factors, along with a field indicating whether the patient has a cardiopathy (this field will be included in the data but kept hidden from the diagnostic system):

### Patient 1

- **Age:** 62 years
- **Gender:** Male
- **Family History:** No known history
- **Smoking Status:** Ex-smoker (quit 10 years ago)
- **BMI (Body Mass Index):** 27 kg/m²
- **Blood Pressure:** 140/85 mmHg
- **Total Cholesterol:** 220 mg/dL
- **LDL Cholesterol:** 140 mg/dL
- **HDL Cholesterol:** 45 mg/dL
- **Triglycerides:** 150 mg/dL
- **Fasting Glucose:** 98 mg/dL
- **Physical Activity:** Moderately active
- **Symptoms:** Occasional chest discomfort, fatigue
- **ECG:** Minor nonspecific ST changes
- **Echocardiogram:** Mild left ventricular hypertrophy

- **Cardiopathy:** Yes

## Response biomistralQ8 pdf_diagnosisi_cos copy.py

     The probability for this patient to have a cardiovascular disease is high. The patient has several risk factors such as age, gender, family history, smoking status, BMI, blood pressure, total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, triglycerides, fasting glucose, and physical activity. The ECG shows minor nonspecific ST changes, and the echocardiogram reveals mild left ventricular hypertrophy. Based on these findings, the patient likely has coronary artery disease (CAD) or heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFNEF).

## Response llama3:7b Q8 pdf_diagnosisi_cos copy 2.py

    question:  what is the probability for this patient Patient 1
    Age: 62 years
    Gender: Male
    Family History: No known history
    Smoking Status: Ex-smoker (quit 10 years ago)
    BMI (Body Mass Index): 27 kg/m²
    Blood Pressure: 140/85 mmHg
    Total Cholesterol: 220 mg/dL
    LDL Cholesterol: 140 mg/dL
    HDL Cholesterol: 45 mg/dL
    Triglycerides: 150 mg/dL
    Fasting Glucose: 98 mg/dL
    Physical Activity: Moderately active
    Symptoms: Occasional chest discomfort, fatigue
    ECG: Minor nonspecific ST changes
    Echocardiogram: Mild left ventricular hypertrophy
    to have a cardiovascular disease, and what disease it would be?
    --------------------------------------
    response:   0.5% chance of having a cardiovascular disease, and the most likely one is coronary artery disease.

## Response biomistralQ4 pdf_diagnosisi_cos copy 2.py

    response:   The patient has multiple risk factors for cardiovascular disease, including age, gender, family history, smoking status, BMI, blood pressure, total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, triglycerides, fasting glucose, physical activity, and symptoms. The patient has a 10-year history of smoking, which is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease. The patient's BMI is in the overweight range, which also increases the risk of cardiovascular disease. The patient's blood pressure is elevated, which is another major risk factor for cardiovascular disease. The patient's total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol levels are above the recommended levels, which are also major risk factors for cardiovascular disease. The patient's HDL cholesterol level is below the recommended level, which is a protective factor against cardiovascular disease. The patient's triglyceride level is elevated, which is another risk factor for cardiovascular disease. The patient's fasting glucose level is within the normal range, but the patient has symptoms of fatigue and occasional chest discomfort,

## Response mixtral_7Bx2_Moe_Q5_k_m pdf_diagnosisi_cos copy 2.py

    response:   Based on the provided information, Patient 1 has several risk factors for cardiovascular disease such as age (62 years), high blood pressure (140/85 mmHg), elevated LDL cholesterol (140 mg/dL), low HDL cholesterol (45 mg/dL), and a family history of unknown cardiovascular risk. He is also an ex-smoker, has a high BMI (27 kg/m²), and shows some signs of metabolic abnormalities with elevated triglycerides (150 mg/dL) and fasting glucose (98 mg/dL). These factors increase his risk for cardiovascular disease, particularly atherosclerosis or coronary artery disease. However, it is important to note that the exact probability of developing a specific cardiovascular disease cannot be determined from this information alone. A more comprehensive evaluation by a healthcare professional would be necessary to accurately assess his risk and determine appropriate interventions.

## Response biomistralQ8 copy2

    response:   The probability for this patient to have a cardiovascular disease is high. He has multiple risk factors for cardiovascular disease including age, family history, smoking status, BMI, blood pressure, total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, triglycerides, fasting glucose, and physical activity. The most likely type of cardiovascular disease he would have is coronary artery disease (CAD).
